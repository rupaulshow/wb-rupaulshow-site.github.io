                    <div class="faq-item">
                      <h5><strong>1. What time should I arrive?</strong></h5>
                      <p>It is at your own discretion as to how early you would like to arrive to hold a place in line. Please note we OVERBOOK the audience and tickets are given on a first come first serve basis. You will need to arrive <strong>NO LATER</strong> than the time that is stated on your tickets.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                      <h5><strong>2. What am I allowed to wear?</strong></h5>
                      <p>Our dress code is <strong>Upscale Casual</strong>. Think Trendy… Think Classy… Think <strong>SOLID BRIGHT COLORS!  **NO LOGOS/WRITING**</strong> on any clothing will be permitted. Dressy jeans are permitted but <strong>NO RIPPED JEANS</strong>.  We ask the audience to refrain from wearing white or all black tops. Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> wear <strong>RUPAUL and/or WB gear. NO LOW CUT/REVEALING SHIRTS, tank tops or tank dresses/spaghetti straps, T-shirts, baseball hats, beanies, shorts, sweat pants, cut-offs, flip-flops, sunglasses, logos, images or baggy clothing</strong>. Group coordinating outfits are not allowed. </p>
                      <p>At RuPaul EVERYONE (Rupaul, show guests AND the audience) walks the runway!! That means to get to your seat in the audience… you have to strut your stuff on the runway! So just remember you’ll be on camera! And then RuPaul will often pick his "Slay of the Day"!</p>
                      <p>Keep in mind floral prints, plaid and other crazy patterns don’t look good on camera, and we know you want to look your best!</p>
                      <p><strong>THERE IS A LONG WALK FROM CHECK-IN TO THE STUDIO. WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO WEAR COMFORTABLE SHOES.</strong></p>
                      <p>Still want to wear your heels at the show? No problem - just pop them in a carrying bag. It is a bit chilly in the studio, so you may want to bring a light sweater. <strong>We reserve the right to deny admission, to the extent permitted by applicable law.</strong></p>
